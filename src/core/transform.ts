 *
 *  ## Content-aware geometry
 *
 *  The gate is **string-only** — every production caller has the text, and
 *  the gate uses it to compute the renderer's exact image cost two ways at
 *  once:
 *
 *  - **Rows** come from `countVisualRows` (matches `wrapLines` line-for-
 *    line, including soft-wraps and codepoint width).
 *  - **Width** comes from `shrinkColsToContent` when `shrinkWidth=true`
 *    (the default): a 16-char `"File not found"` block bills for an
 *    ~80 px wide canvas, not the full 508 px slab canvas. This matters
 *    most for tool_result and reminder blocks, which dominate per-turn
 *    image cost and are usually much narrower than `cols`.
 *
 *  Set `shrinkWidth=false` for the system slab (multi-col, fills the
 *  configured `cols` deliberately to maximise OCR density) and anywhere
 *  the caller needs full-canvas pricing for telemetry parity.
 *
 *  ## No numeric overload
 *
 *  The historical `textOrLen: string | number` shape existed for unit-
 *  test back-compat. The numeric path assumed every char filled a full-
 *  width row (= lower-bound rows = under-estimated image cost), which
 *  silently let net-losing compressions through whenever a caller passed
 *  `text.length` instead of `text`. Removed.

 * That's the right question when the request is cold on both sides, but
 * the wrong question once Anthropic has already cached the text-based
 * prefix — text-at-10% beats image-at-100% per-turn. The text prefix's
 * cache *will* eventually expire, though (5-min idle, 4-breakpoint
 * cliff, system-slab churn), and on that cold turn the giant text pays
 * `cache_create` (1.25×) on the full uncompressed prefix while an image
 * prefix pays `cache_create` once and `cache_read` (0.1×) for the rest
 * of the session.
 *
 * Honest expected-lifetime-cost framing over `N` future turns starting
 * from a *worst-case warm* state for the image (cache_create on turn 1,
 * cache_read on turns 2..N) and a best-case warm state for the text
 * (cache_read every turn for the full N). The gate accepts the collapse
 * iff
 *
 *   I × (CC + CR×(N-1)) < T × CR × N
 *
 * where I = image_tokens, T = text_tokens, CC = 1.25, CR = 0.10.
 *
 * Examples (CC=1.25, CR=0.10):
 *   N=1:  I < 0.08 × T   (essentially never — text-at-10% beats image)
 *   N=5:  I < 0.30 × T
 *   N=10: I < 0.47 × T
 *   N=20: I < 0.64 × T
 *
 * Real history typically renders to I/T ≈ 0.3–0.5 (one image per
 * ~14 KB of dense text vs ~2,500 tokens per image at 1.5 cpt), so a
 * horizon of N=5–10 flips a lot of currently-rejected collapses
 * into accepts without ever taking a bet a single-turn session would lose.

  // In-image instruction header. Co-renders the OCR framing into the same PNG

  // production corpus (Opus 4.7, eval/eval-L1-ocr.mjs `reflow-inimage`
  // variant), recovering the -5.93pp reflow regression entirely. Mechanism:
  // single-modal task framing — the encoder stays in image-reading mode for
  // both the instruction and the content, no cross-modal switch. Delimiter
  // lines are deliberately heavy so the model pattern-matches "instruction
  // zone ends, content begins" without ambiguity.
  //
  // Cache impact on deploy: the image bytes change, so prefix-cached prefixes
  // built against the OLD intro layout invalidate. Every host pays one
  // cache_create on its first post-deploy turn, then warm-caches at the new
  // image. Steady-state cost is identical (the header amortizes over the
  // same cache prefix the slab already uses).
  // Header text — written as continuous prose, NO hard \n inside paragraphs.
  // The renderer soft-wraps to `cols`, packing rows densely. Hard newlines
  // here would (a) leave ~38 cells of dead margin per row and (b) on the
  // reflow path become visible ↵ glyphs, polluting the header with noise
  // markers that only make sense for content. Genuine paragraph breaks
  // (between banner / prose / banner) stay as \n.
    // 3. Render to one or more PNGs at the width chosen above. The slab
  // shrinks to the longest actual wrapped line (see `slabCols` computation
  // before the gate) so the canvas matches what the gate measured. This
  // keeps the cache prefix byte-identical when the natural floor doesn't
  // move turn-to-turn. (Per-block contexts use `textToImageBlocks` with
  // `shrinkWidth=true`; this is the same idea, hoisted above the gate.)
