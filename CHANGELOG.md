# Changelog

All notable changes to pxpipe are documented here. This project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (pre-1.0: minor = features /
behavioral changes, patch = fixes).

## Unreleased (pxpipe-cn fork) — 2026-07-05

### Added — Chinese (CJK) adaptation
- **Three-layer glyph atlas:** Spleen (ASCII) → Fusion Pixel 8px monospaced
  (OFL-1.1, CJK ranges) → Unifont fallthrough with per-glyph .notdef
  detection. Full U+4E00–9FFF coverage; zero hanzi drops on the real-session
  CN corpus; deterministic build pinned by hash in tests.
- **2× upscale render path for CJK-heavy blocks** (`shouldUpscaleCjk`,
  cjkFraction ≥ 0.3): 150 cols, nearest-neighbor pixelScale=2, 2px inter-line
  gap (`CJK_LINE_GAP`) — full page 1516×716, under the API's 1568-edge /
  ~1.15 MP box. L1 OCR 81.7% → 93.7% from scaling alone; the 2px gap fixes
  the packed-reflow "interlocking rows" failure (CN gist recall 39% → 75%;
  hanzi fill the full 8px cell, unlike Latin). Shared
  `CJK_DENSE_RENDER_STYLE` keeps gate pricing and all render sites in
  lockstep. OpenAI path unchanged.
- **Gate recalibration for CJK:** image side counts cells (CJK = 2) in
  `countVisualRows`/`lineRows`; text side blends CPT_CJK=1.5
  (`src/core/cpt.ts`, confirmed by usage-probe regression, R²=0.996);
  min-chars thresholds are token-equivalent (a 4k-hanzi tool_result now
  images instead of passing through). Pure-English decisions bit-identical
  to upstream.
- **Telemetry:** `cjk_fraction` / `cpt_used` on TrackEvent for ongoing
  recalibration from events.jsonl.
- **Usage-probe baseline fallback** for relay upstreams without
  count_tokens: when the free count_tokens probe fails, a sampled
  (`PXPIPE_USAGE_PROBE_RATE`, default 0/off) max_tokens=1 replay of the
  pre-compression body against `/v1/messages` reads the billed usage block
  as `baseline_tokens` (cache_control stripped, thinking dropped, fired in
  finalize off the latency path). `baseline_probe_method`
  (`count_tokens` | `usage_sample`) lands on TrackEvent.
- **CN eval suite:** `eval/eval-cn-needle.mjs`, `eval/eval-cn-gist.mjs`,
  `scripts/cn-baseline.mjs`, `scripts/calibrate-cn-cpt.mjs`, CN corpus
  extraction (`--cjk`), offline `tests/cn.test.ts` (atlas coverage, cell
  math, gate fixtures, 2× geometry). Findings: `docs/FINDINGS-cn.md`.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-07-03

### Security
- Worker: deploying with an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`/`OPENAI_API_KEY` override now
  requires `PXPIPE_WORKER_SECRET`; callers authenticate via the
  `x-pxpipe-secret` header. Without the secret the Worker returns 503 instead
  of proxying on your key.
- Node: dashboard binds to loopback (127.0.0.1) by default; set `HOST` to opt
  into all interfaces.
- Dashboard: JSON endpoints no longer send `access-control-allow-origin: *`.

### Fixed
- History imaging no longer teaches the model to skip `Read` calls.
- Fixed the pxpipe-vs-plain-Claude demo image link.

### Docs
- README cut to 217 lines — caveats deduped, benchmark prose moved to eval/
  links. Demo URLs pinned to 127.0.0.1 to match the loopback bind; demo
  details revised for Fable 5 and Opus 4.8.

## 0.7.2 — 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- **History collapse no longer truncates the opening task prompt.** When a
  long run pushed the opening user turn past the demotion boundary, the
  collapsed turn carried only a ~300-char preview
  (`LATEST_COLLAPSED_USER_PREVIEW_CHARS`) — the actual question could be cut
  off entirely, and the model answered from whatever fragment survived. The
  most recent collapsed user turn now rides along verbatim (up to
  `LATEST_COLLAPSED_USER_VERBATIM_CHARS`, default 4000). Verified end-to-end
  on the effective-context needle bench: with collapse actively engaged
  (10 turns demoted), the model reproduces the ground-truth answer exactly.
  (#7)

## 0.7.1 — 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- **Relocated env block is now wrapped in `<system-reminder>` tags.** The
  volatile `# Environment` text that pxpipe moves out of the cached system
  prefix used to be appended to the last user message as bare prose — on an
  empty or short user turn it could read as the user's entire message, and
  models would mis-attribute it ("your message consisted of environment
  metadata"). The block now carries an explicit provenance header
  ("Context relocated by pxpipe from the system prompt … not written by the
  user"), fixing attribution. No cache impact: the wrapper rides the volatile
  tail behind all cache breakpoints (~60 chars/request).

## 0.7.0 — 2026-07-03

### Added
- **Per-request telemetry: `stop_reason` + safety-flag logging.** Every proxied
  request now records how it ended, so refusal/classifier trips are measurable
  instead of anecdotal.
- **Headless bench:** multi-turn `claude -p` driver + `events.jsonl` scorer for
  fast, non-interactive A/B runs; plus a constant-cost render-style eval harness.
- **`PXPIPE_DUMP_DIR`** persists rendered PNGs per request for demo/debug
  inspection of exactly what the model saw.
- **Dashboard/factsheet:** one-time cache-create losses tagged in the recent
  table; factsheet carries occurrence counts with ticket-style codes.
- **Demos:** `claude-sonnet-5` arm support; fable arm runs `claude-fable-5[1m]`
  (1M ctx) to match opus/sonnet.

### Fixed
- **Imaged slab frozen at first render.** Volatile content (skill listings, cwd
  caches) stays out of the imaged prefix so turn-2 system sha matches turn-1 —
  no more silent cache-create churn between turns.
- **Volatile env text relocated behind all cache breakpoints** (not just the
  first), plus cross-session slab stability.
- **Refusal-classifier defusing:** provenance-framed slab banner and reworded
  tool-docs stub/header — eliminates spurious `reasoning_extraction` refusals
  on compressed context.
- **Render fit to 1568×728 (~1.15 MP)** on the Anthropic path for WYSIWYG
  glyphs (what we rasterize is what the model samples).
- Demo cost-ab arms run `--no-chrome` for reproducible token baselines.

### Removed
- `compressSchemas` knob (superseded by slab stability work).

### Docs
- **Fable 5 side-by-side demo** in the README with verified numbers from the
  recording — same two tasks, same answers: plain $42.21 / 96% context vs
  pxpipe $4.51 — plus the honest caveat (compressed arm needed one nudge for
  single-reply format) and the full attempt log in
  `demo/effective-context/ATTEMPTS.md`.
- Node transform hook documented as kill-switch only.

## 0.6.10 — 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- **Dashboard savings no longer invent phantom rows from cache *assumptions*
  about the text counterfactual.** Warmth for the imagined text path is now taken
  strictly from the **observed cache state** of the real request (`cr > 0` = warm,
  `cr === 0` = cold) instead of being inferred from the wall-clock cache TTL. Using
  TTL to claim text "would have been cached" while the actual image request read no
  cache was an unobservable counterfactual that could manufacture negative
  ("loss") rows — such as the reported "800%-worse" row — from cache assumptions
  rather than real token deltas. A completed same-prefix prior now only sizes the
  reused-vs-grown split; with none, full reuse is assumed (conservative). Threaded
  identically through the live `update()`, the JSONL `replay()`, and
  `aggregateSessions` so the dashboard and session views can't drift.
  (`baseline.ts`, `dashboard.ts`, `sessions.ts`)
- **Recent table surfaces imaging losses honestly** instead of hiding negative
  deltas as "—": losses render in red, and the headings are clarified as
  billing-equivalent input tokens ("Saved/lost"). (`dashboard/fragments.ts`)

## 0.6.4 — 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- **Anchor collapsed-history recency on the Anthropic path.** Two lightweight
  guardrails so the model doesn't resurface a stale low-N opening turn as the live
  request: (1) the synthetic history banner now adds "earlier turns may contain
  questions/tasks already answered later in this same history; do not reopen low-N
  turns unless the live text after this block asks you to"; (2) a bounded (~300-char)
  text pointer after the history images names the most-recent collapsed user turn
  (`<user t="N">…</user>`) so the model has a recency anchor in legible text, while
  still labeling it prior context. The pointer sits after the cache_control
  breakpoint, so it does not invalidate the frozen image cache. (`history.ts`)

## 0.6.3 — 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- **GPT autonomous agents no longer lose the live request to history imaging.**
  Autonomous GPT agents (OpenCode/gpt-5.5) send one human request then a long run of
  tool turns. The lone request is the oldest turn, so history collapse imaged it first
  and the model lost it — confabulating the request and drifting off-task (observed:
  editing a file instead of answering a compare question). Fix: the most-recent user
  turn *overall* is kept as legible text, spliced between before-pin and after-pin
  history images inside the synthetic user message; older user turns stay imaged (they
  must not look live). The `developer` guard now echoes the request verbatim. History
  stays imaged on both sides of the pin, so compression barely changes. Both Chat
  Completions and Responses paths. GPT support remains opt-in/WIP (hidden in the
  dashboard), so this does not affect the Anthropic path. (`openai-history.ts`,
  `openai.ts`)

  Cache safety (adversarially reviewed): the pin fires only when the latest user turn
  is *inside* the collapse range — otherwise it is already native text in the kept
  tail — so the pin's position is fixed across a run and the before/after section grid
  stays byte-stable. An undersized before-pin remainder merges into the previous
  section rather than emitting a sub-threshold (net-negative) image.

## 0.6.2 — 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- **GPT history image cap.** A hard cap (16) on GPT history images. Long OpenCode
  sessions could otherwise render 80+ images — token-cheap but slow enough that
  gpt-5.5 times out before first token. The cap images the oldest sections up to the
  limit and leaves the rest as text; no context dropped, no live tool state orphaned.
  (`openai-history.ts`)
- **GPT "live request" guard.** A `developer`-role note after the history image tells
  the model the image is prior context, not the current request — reinforcing the
  turn-index so a stale opening turn doesn't read as live. (`openai.ts`)
- **Honest cache math.** Savings are priced warm whenever a cache read was actually
  observed (`cache_read > 0`), even when pxpipe has no in-memory warmth prior (after a
  restart/eviction or on the first tracked turn). Pricing those turns cold billed the
  text counterfactual a 1.25× create on a prefix we know was cached — fabricating
  inflated "saved" rows. Applied across the live dashboard, its replay path, and the
  Sessions panel. (`dashboard.ts`, `sessions.ts`)

## 0.6.1 — 2026-06-21

### Fixed
- **GPT opening prompt no longer reads as the live request.** The static slab is now
  inserted as its own dedicated image item instead of being bundled onto the first
  real user message. That message stayed protected from collapse, so the opening
  prompt floated at the front as un-collapsed, live-looking text (right next to the
  slab image) — and gpt-5.x would answer it instead of the actual latest turn. The
  opening prompt is now collapsible, turn-indexed history like every other old turn;
  only the slab item is protected. Both Chat Completions and Responses paths.
  (`openai.ts`)

## 0.6.0 — 2026-06-21

Structure-through role attribution and a turn-index recency anchor for collapsed
history images, plus per-model GPT rendering profiles. The model now reads who
said each turn and how recent it is, instead of reconstructing it from a
flattened, role-ambiguous blob (which led it to resurface the opening turn as if
it were the live request).

### Added
- **Turn-index recency anchor.** Each collapsed turn serializes as `<user t="N">` /
  `<assistant t="N">` with an absolute turn index (larger N = more recent), so the
  model can distinguish turn 1 from turn 60 and stops treating the opening turn as
  the live request. Absolute (never relative) so frozen chunks stay byte-identical
  and keep hitting the prompt cache. Applied on both the Anthropic (`history.ts`)
  and GPT (`openai-history.ts`) paths.
- **colorByRole role tinting.** `<user>`/`<assistant>` tags in the history image are
  colored via a parallel "slot string" carried from serialize time, replacing the
  parse-back that miscolored a body quoting a literal tag. (`render.ts`)
- **Per-model GPT profiles (`gpt-model-profiles.ts`).** Vision-cost regime, strip
  width, and max image height per model id, retunable via `PXPIPE_GPT_PROFILES` (a
  JSON model-id-prefix map) without a code change. Built-ins are behavior-identical
  to the prior hardcoded values.

### Changed
- **↵-packing for sentinel-bearing content.** A pre-existing ↵ (U+21B5) in content
  is swapped to ⏎ (U+23CE) in render-prep so `reflow` packs newlines instead of
  bailing to a raw, unpacked render — common when the content is about pxpipe
  itself (rendered dumps, OCR). Render-only; originals are preserved.

### Fixed
- **Banner single source of truth.** The GPT intro/outro now alias the Anthropic
  constants in `history.ts` instead of being byte-copies, so the two paths cannot
  silently drift on turn-attribution wording.
- **Slot/text alignment.** `slotCopyBody` neutralizes literal slot-marker control
  chars to a width-equivalent control char (U+0003) instead of a space, which
  `minifyForRender` would strip as trailing whitespace and desync the slot from the
  text (smearing role colors).

## 0.5.0 — 2026-06-20

Cache-stable history-collapse imaging for both providers, with GPT-5.6 promoted
to the default imaged scope. Old conversation history collapses into rendered
PNG sections so the model reads a compact image instead of re-billed text, while
prompt caching and tool-call behavior are preserved.

### Added
- **GPT history collapse (`openai-history.ts`).** Append-only, o200k
  token-length sectioning. Sections seal only at a tool-closed boundary (the
  open call-id set is empty), so a `function_call` and its
  `function_call_output` never split across the collapse cut.
- **GPT + Anthropic dashboard rendering.** Per-family model toggles, persisted
  metrics, thumbnail-expired session UI, and reflow/newline handling.

### Changed
- **Default imaged scope is now `claude-fable-5` + `gpt-5.6`.** GPT-5.6 is
  promoted from opt-in (0.4.0) to on by default. `gpt-5.5` and `claude-opus-4-8`
  stay opt-in: they degrade reading dense imaged history (gist drift), so
  silently imaging them by default is wrong. Promotion is gated on an OCR/recall
  threshold.
- **Anthropic cache contract (`history.ts`).** Append-only per-chunk rendering;
  `cache_control` markers are preserved/moved, never added; chunk boundaries
  align with caller marker seams for byte-stable prefix caching.
- **GPT image budget (`openai.ts`).** `detail:'original'` for gpt-5.x, flagship
  vision-multiplier fix, and a patch cap; schema-strip preserves real
  descriptions.
- **Savings accounting (`openai-savings.ts`).** Now computed on a
  `cached_tokens` + vision-token basis.

### Fixed
- **OpenAI 400 on long Responses-API sessions.** `"No tool call found for
  function call output with call_id ..."` no longer occurs — the tool-closed
  sectioning boundary keeps each `function_call`/`function_call_output` pair
  intact across the collapse cut.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-06-19

New library surface for harness authors, opt-in GPT-5.x / Responses API support,
and a round of dashboard-honesty and cache-correctness fixes.

### Added
- **Library API (`pxpipe/transform`):** `transformAnthropicMessages` now accepts
  `keepSharp` (pin specific blocks as text so the caller controls what stays
  legible) and `emitRecoverable` (a provenance-recovery channel surfaced on
  `info.recoverable`). New exported types `KeepSharpBlock`, `RecoverableBlock`.
- **Edge / Workers-safe packaging.** `process.env` access is `typeof`-guarded;
  `@napi-rs/canvas` moved to `devDependencies` (the atlas is baked at build time),
  so the runtime is pure-JS and runs on Node and Cloudflare Workers unchanged.
- **GPT-5.x family + Responses API (opt-in, off by default).** `isPxpipeSupportedGptModel`
  gates the `gpt-5`/`5.5`/`5.6`/`-mini`/`-nano` family; a 768 px portrait-strip
  render profile avoids OpenAI's mandatory shortest-side-768 downscale; an OpenAI
  vision-token cost model replaces the Anthropic 750 px/token math for the GPT
  path; `transformOpenAIResponses` compresses `/v1/responses` (Codex). Still gated
  off until the day-one OCR-fidelity eval on a released GPT-5.x model.

### Fixed
- **Cache anchor relocation.** The single cache breakpoint moved from the static
  slab onto the **last history image** (which sits after the slab in prefix order),
  so slab + history cache as one stable prefix — created once, then read at 0.1×.
  Previously the ~141k-token history image re-created at the 1.25× rate on warm
  turns, turning a real compression win into a net loss. Marker count is
  unchanged: pxpipe still never *adds* a breakpoint, only relocates the caller's.
- **Dashboard honesty.** The Details headline and the session hero now use
  cache-weighted tokens (matching the Saved column) instead of dividing the raw
  `count_tokens` baseline by sent tokens — which over-claimed "fewer tokens" even
  on requests that were a net loss after caching.
- **Restart restore.** Replayed rows now reconstruct the Saved delta and the
  Details breakdown from the persisted JSONL; image thumbnails are honestly marked
  expired rather than left blank.
- **CI:** regenerated `pnpm-lock.yaml` after the canvas dependency move
  (`--frozen-lockfile` had been rejecting every push).
- **Node:** clean exit on Ctrl+C during in-flight streams and idle keep-alive.

### Changed
- **Dashboard redesign:** light flame theme, plain-language hero, and per-request
  image-vs-text transparency (which context became an image, which stayed text).
- **Docs:** lead with token reduction rather than dollar savings (pricing is a
  side-effect of tokens saved); added `HISTORY_CACHE_MODEL.md`; large comment
  cleanup across the core (~1,640 lines trimmed) with deep math moved to docs.
- **Deps:** patched 6 advisories (vite, undici, esbuild).

## 0.3.1 — 2026-06-17

### Changed
- **Demo:** the side-by-side A/B clip moved to Google Drive (the committed copy
  was too low-res to read). The README keeps the preview thumbnail and links out
  to the video; the 8.9 MB video binary is no longer in the package/repo tree.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-06-17

Render-sizing overhaul, dashboard transparency, honest savings accounting, and a
multi-agent code review with five confirmed fixes. Reviewed at extra-high recall
(10 finder angles → verify → sweep).

### Changed
- **Render page ceiling raised to ~1932×1932.** Fable 5 / Opus 4.8 accept images
  up to 2576 px long edge / 4784 visual tokens, but a request with >20 images
  (pxpipe always sends many) is held to the stricter ≤2000 px/side rule — so the
  real ceiling is ~1932×1932 (1928×1928 = 69×69 = 4761 tokens). `MAX_HEIGHT_PX`
  1568→1932; dense tool/history pages now `DENSE_CONTENT_COLS=384` /
  `DENSE_CONTENT_CHARS_PER_IMAGE=92160` (1928×1928 full page) — fewer image
  blocks at the same OCR-validated 5×8 cell. The static slab is unchanged
  (313 cols / 1573×1280). Pages never trip a server-side downscale. Note: the
  larger per-page density uses the validated 5×8 cell and stays within
  Anthropic's pixel/token limits, but OCR legibility at this page size has not
  been independently re-eval'd (revert = the four render constants).
- **Opus is OFF by default.** Production scope defaults to **Fable-5 only**;
  Opus 4.8/4.7 are opt-in (they read imaged content at a measurable tax — see
  FINDINGS.md). Opt in via `PXPIPE_MODELS` or the dashboard chips.
- **Honest savings accounting.** Per-turn/session savings are the real
  `baseline_eff − actual_eff` with **no ≥0 floor** — a net-losing turn (e.g. a
  cache_create-heavy image rewrite) now reports the real loss instead of a
  fabricated 0. (Dashboard renders negatives explicitly.)

### Added
- **Dashboard "how your context works" panel** — per-request token flow
  (as-text → real) + the exact-char breakdown of what became images + a gallery
  of every rendered page, reached via a **"view"** link on each recent-requests
  row.
- **Flexible "compress models" chips** — the toggle set is the union of a model
  catalog (Fable 5, Opus 4.8/4.7, Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5), the `PXPIPE_MODELS`
  env scope, and the currently-active scope, so any env-enabled model stays
  toggleable (off ↔ on). Runtime-only override of the compress scope.
- **Demos** — `demo/cost-ab/` (cost A/B on a real coding task) and
  `demo/effective-context/` (recall-at-scale needle test), each with a model
  arg: defaults to Fable, `a.sh opus` to override. Plus `eval/ab/` token-savings
  scripts.

### Fixed (from the code review)
- **Tool_result over-truncation (regression):** the paging/break-even gate and
  `truncateForBudget` predicted against the slab geometry (313 cols / 159 rows)
  while the dense renderer emits 384 cols / 240 rows — so large tool_results
  were truncated far earlier than the 10-image cap required, silently dropping
  output that would have rendered. The gate, paging budget, and image-count
  estimate now price the same page the renderer produces.
- **Garbled session headline:** a net-losing session showed "-7% fewer tokens";
  now phrased honestly as "N% more tokens".
- **Context-map "view" mis-resolution:** `contextHistory` capped at 30 while the
  recent table showed 50 rows, so older rows' "view" links silently showed the
  *latest* request's breakdown. Caps aligned; an evicted/unrecorded request now
  shows an explicit "no longer available" message instead of wrong data.
- **Multi-col token cap:** the multi-col width ceiling now respects the 4784
  visual-token limit at full page height (was bounded only by the 2000 px side
  limit, which could produce a 4968-token page that the API rejects).
- **Doc/code contradictions:** `baseline.ts` and caller comments no longer claim
  a ≥0 clamp the code intentionally doesn't apply.

### Docs
- Rewrote `docs/RENDER_SIZING.md` and updated `docs/TRANSFORM_INFO.md`,
  `README.md`, and in-code comments for the new ceiling and limits.
