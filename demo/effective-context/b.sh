PROMPT='context/ has needle.txt plus filler-NNN.txt files. Using the Read tool on each file individually (do NOT use grep, bash, find, or any search tool — I need every file actually read into your context): FIRST read needle.txt, THEN read every filler-NNN.txt in numerical order. As you read, COUNT the lines that contain the exact token "AUDIT-ZX9". Only after reading ALL files, answer using only what you read: (1) the final ledger balance of account ZX-9 from needle.txt, (2) how many lines contained "AUDIT-ZX9", and (3) their sum. Reply as: balance=<n>, count=<m>, final=<n+m>.'

# Model: defaults to Fable 5; override with the first arg (friendly name or full id):

#   ./b.sh sonnet → claude-sonnet-4-6    ./b.sh claude-... → used verbatim
# NOTE: for pxpipe to actually compress, the :47824 proxy must allow this model
# (Fable-only by default — see PXPIPE_MODELS or the dashboard "compress models"
# chips). A model the proxy doesn't cover just passes through uncompressed.
